# 🎨 CodePen Pens — Front-End Demos and Experiments

A personal collection of front-end experiments, challenges, and learning projects.
Each pen is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no build steps — to keep things simple, accessible, and transparent.

## 🤓 Overview

This project collects and organises my CodePen demos and experiments in one place.
It serves both as an archive and as a personal reference for design, animation, and accessibility techniques I've explored over time.

Some pens are recent, while others are older examples of my early learning — all are included to show progress and experimentation.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run a lightweight local server using Node.js:

```bash
# Serve the site from the src directory
npx serve src -l 5173
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
This will correctly load `pens.json` and allow fetch requests without CORS errors.

---

## 📜 Usage / Scripts

- **`tools/generate-pens-json.mjs`** — Scans the `src/pens` folder and builds `pens.json`
  Used by the index page to display pens dynamically.
- **`npx serve src -l 5173`** — Runs a local development server on port 5173.
- **`node tools/generate-pens-json.mjs`** — Updates `pens.json` after adding or renaming pens.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES Modules)** — core technologies
- **Node.js** — used for tooling and local server
- **Accessible-first design** — semantic HTML, visible focus states, and logical tab order

---

## 📸 Live / Demo

Each project can be viewed directly on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/karlhorning)
or locally through the index page, which provides filters and thumbnails for each demo.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

- **Previews:** Stored in `src/assets/previews/`
- **Pen data:** Generated into `src/pens.json`
  Run `node tools/generate-pens-json.mjs` to update after adding new pens.
- **Base URL:** Adjust `BASE_URL` in `generate-pens-json.mjs` if deploying as a user site instead of a project site.

---

## 🔄 Deployment

This project is deployed automatically to **GitHub Pages** via a workflow defined in
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

- The workflow uploads the contents of `src/` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
- No manual steps are required — commits trigger deployment automatically.
- Output URL: `https://www.karlhorning.dev/codepen-pens/`

## ♿ Accessibility Note

Some older pens **do not meet accessibility standards** and are included as part of my learning history.

They're preserved to demonstrate development progress and to encourage transparency in creative growth.
