# CodePen Pens

## Description

This repo contains all of my CodePen Pens. They have been moved to a single repo as they are all quite small projects, making them easier to manage in one place.

This repo contains the following projects:

- [Portfolio 2016](./src/portfolio-2016/)
- [Portfolio 2019](./src/portfolio-2019/)
- [Random Password Generator](./src/random-password-generator/)
