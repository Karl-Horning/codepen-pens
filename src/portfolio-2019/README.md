## Description

This repository holds the source code for my 2019 portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a web developer. The portfolio is structured with a modern and responsive design, featuring CSS animations and media queries to ensure optimal viewing across various devices.

The project originated as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects, specifically the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage" challenge. It fulfils the following user stories:

- [x] **User Story #1:** My portfolio should have a welcome section with an id of welcome-section.
- [x] **User Story #2:** The welcome section should have an h1 element that contains text.
- [x] **User Story #3:** My portfolio should have a projects section with an id of projects.
- [x] **User Story #4:** The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of project-tile to hold a project.
- [x] **User Story #5:** The projects section should contain at least one link to a project.
- [x] **User Story #6:** My portfolio should have a navbar with an id of navbar.
- [x] **User Story #7:** The navbar should contain at least one link that I can click on to navigate to different sections of the page.
- [x] **User Story #8:** My portfolio should have a link with an id of profile-link, which opens my GitHub or FCC profile in a new tab.
- [x] **User Story #9:** My portfolio should have at least one media query.
